More importantly, I learned about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gained the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, I learned about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.",

The course started with a design and information literacy perspective, touching on what makes a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of visualizations. After that, we focused on the technology used to make visualizations in python, matplotlib, and introduce users to best practices when creating basic charts and how to realize design decisions in the framework. Then I got the chance to see a variety of basic statistical charts helping me to identify when a particular method is good for a particular problem. The course ended with a discussion of other forms of structuring and visualizing data. (2nd course in the specialization : Applied Data Science with Python Specialization)",
